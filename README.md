# CS2200-Proj1
Aim to build the datapath for LC-898, project description in project1.pdf.
1. Make sure to install Install Java 8u152, Python 3.7 or greater and
CircuitSim from https://www.roiatalla.com/public/CircuitSim/
2. Use command like "python assembler.py -i lc898 --hex test.s" to get .hex file of assembly program .s
3. Open LC-898.sim with CircuitSim and copy content in .hex file to RAM in Datapath tab
4. Choose a proper clock frequency, enable simulation and clock
5. You should find the result in $vo register by double-click the register file in Datapath tab
6. All available instructions of LC-898 can be found in Appendix A in project1.pdf
